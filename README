rbt_prs is a robots.txt parser written in PHP and intended for checking
whether or not your bot can access a given URL.

Currently it provides just one function:
	isUrlBotSafe($url, $your_useragent, $debug)
Setting either of the latter two parameters to NULL will make them use their
default values.

This piece of software is already in use in real life at
http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/humble/ and was originally written for the
site author just because it was the correct way of doing things.
