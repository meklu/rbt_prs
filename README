rbt_prs is a robots.txt parser written in PHP and intended for checking
whether or not your bot can access a given URL.

Currently it provides just one function:
	isUrlBotSafe($url, $your_useragent, $robots_txt, $redirects, $debug)
Setting any of the last four parameters to NULL will make them use their
default values.

The first argument, $url, is the only required argument and means the URL you
would like to check.

The second argument, $your_useragent, is the user agent string your bot will
use. While it isn't mandatory to select one, it is highly advised.

The third argument, $robots_txt, is useful when you want to go through several
URLs with just a single download of robots.txt. It allows you to use your own
rules on a given URL. You could utilise the argument like this:
	$myrules = file_get_contents("http://example.com/robots.txt");
	isUrlBotSafe("http://example.com/", "Fancybot", $myrules);
	isUrlBotSafe("http://example.com/contact", "Fancybot", $myrules);
	isUrlBotSafe("http://example.com/blog", "Fancybot", $myrules);
	isUrlBotSafe("http://example.com/about", "Fancybot", $myrules);

The fourth argument, $redirects, is only useful when you let the function
download the robots.txt. It allows you to handle HTTP redirects in a slightly
better way than having to miserably fail when grabbing the file.
Values that are 1 or less will disable redirects, whereas FALSE will leave
things the way they are. TRUE will set the value to 20. Here's how to use a
similar approach with $robots_txt defined.
	$opts = array('http' => array('method' => 'GET',
				      'max_redirects' => 20)
		     );
	$context = stream_context_create($opts);
	$myrules = file_get_contents("http://example.com/robots.txt", FALSE, $context);

The fifth argument, $debug, will make the function verbose and have it print
all sorts of useful analysis on the rules.
